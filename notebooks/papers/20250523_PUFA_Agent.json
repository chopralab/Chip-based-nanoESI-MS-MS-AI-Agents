The AI used the 'call_RAG_agent' tool to find information. OzID, or ozone-induced dissociation, is an analytical technique used for near-complete structural assignment of unknown lipids within complex mixtures without prior fractionation or derivatization. It can identify the presence of isomeric lipids in complex mixtures and elucidate the position of double bonds within mass-selected lipid ions. This technique can be applied both in series and in parallel with conventional collision-induced dissociation (CID) for structural assignment of lipids. The process involves the reaction of lipid ions with ozone to form fragment ions that allow for the unambiguous identification of double bond positions within the lipids. The human asked for a summary of OzID, but the AI did not provide any action or observation. The human then asked about the fatty acids found in NIST human plasma. The AI used the 'call_RAG_agent' tool to find information. The fatty acids found in NIST human plasma include a variety of straight-chain fatty acids ranging from C12 to C24.
