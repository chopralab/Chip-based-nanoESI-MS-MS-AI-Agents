Highest signal intensity (~10x improvement), slightly higher spray instability.\n\n2. Matrix A (Standard Matrix): 6:3:1 Methanol (20 mM ammonium formate):Acetonitrile:Isopropanol (10% IPA). Moderate signal, good spray stability.\n\n3. Matrix C (Reduced Isopropanol): 12:6:1 Methanol (20 mM ammonium formate):Acetonitrile:Isopropanol (~5% IPA). Moderate signal, stable spray.\n\n4.

It's interesting to see how the different solvent matrix compositions affected the signal intensity and spray stability in your lipid analysis. Based on your results, it seems like Matrix D provided the highest signal intensity, although with slightly higher spray instability. You could perhaps try fine-tuning the ratios in Matrix D to see if you can maintain the high signal while improving the spray stability. Also, as you noted, the presence of ammonium salt seems crucial for signal detection. Continue to include it in your solvents for future experiments."
