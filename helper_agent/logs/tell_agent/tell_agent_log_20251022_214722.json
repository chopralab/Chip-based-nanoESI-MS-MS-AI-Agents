  "observation": "Project SolventMatrix, operated by TGL, evaluated solvent matrices for nanoESI-MS/MS lipidomics. Two solvent systems were retrieved via RAG (1:2 CHCl₃/MeOH and 1:2:4 CHCl₃/MeOH/IPA), while three additional matrices were contributed by the human operator based on prior LC-MS/MS experience (2:1 MeOH/ACN, 2:1 MeOH/IPA, and 5:3:2 MeOH/IPA/ACN). Using Avanti brain lipid extract as the test sample, five lipid classes were analyzed: Cer, PC, PE, PS, and TG. Across all classes, the lab-validated (human-selected) solvents produced higher total ion chromatogram (TIC) intensities than the literature-derived RAG recommendations. Specifically, 2:1 MeOH/ACN yielded the highest average and maximum TIC for PC, PE, and TG, while 2:1 MeOH/IPA was optimal for Cer and PS. These results were stored in the agent's memory with associated metadata (project: SolventMatrix; operator: TGL), demonstrating that human-validated matrices consistently outperform RAG-only selections. Based on these findings, the recommended solvent for future chip-based nanoESI-MS/MS lipidomics experiments is 2:1 MeOH/ACN, which provides the strongest and most reproducible ionization performance across multiple lipid classes.",
