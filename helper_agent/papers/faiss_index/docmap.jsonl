Introduction\nDysregulation of lipid metabolism is a critical contributor to\nthe etiology of obesity and related metabolic diseases such as\ndiabetes, fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis. A growing body\nof evidence demonstrates that lipid metabolism and its complex\noutput of molecular lipid species play a key role in the develop-\nment of metabolic syndrome[1]. However, it is still unknown how\nmetabolic diseases affect the entire molecular lipid landscape of\ncells and tissues, and exactly what metabolic ripple effects cause\ndetrimental effects. Lipidomic studies in clinical settings offer a\npowerful strategy to pinpoint the mechanistic details by which\nalterations in tissue-speciﬁc lipid metabolism are directly inte-\ngrated into systemic metabolic homeostasis, but necessitate the\napplication of high-throughput mass spectrometric methodology\ncapable of quantifying molecular lipid species on a lipidome-wide\nscale."}
